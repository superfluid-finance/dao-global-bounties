**Welcome to the 2021 DAO Global Hackathon!**

Our Goal for This Hackathon: **Empower hackers to bring the power of Superfluid to DAOs.**

**Bounties Are Focused On:**    
    - Salaries/Token Vesting/Rewarding Community Members
    - Voting
    - Integrations with pre-existing DAO tools

This is an event focused on DAO tooling. It's also a highly collaborative event, and you'll see that we've co-sponsored several bounties with other teams. 

Superfluid provides new ways to reward DAO community members, and to encourage their participation. If you're a builder joining this event, we want to help you build things that enable better coordination mechanisms & payment options for DAOs. 

**This Hackathon is a 2 part event:**

1) 2 Weeks for Bounties - due by Nov 12th

2) 1 month for open hacking - from Nov 12th to mid Dec. 

Bounty prizes are determined by the Superfluid team and co-sponsors. The latter month of hacking (also called the 'Open Lanes' portion of the hackathon) is determined by a group of judges chosen by the event organizers. Our goal is to encourage hackers to successfully complete our bounties, and to provide technical support and encouragement to teams that want to build larger projects during the second part of the hackathon.

Our bounties have been deliberately chosen to be items that could be expanded upon into larger projects. Regardless of the initial bounty submissions, we will encourage teams building on Superfluid to build something cool during the Open Lanes portion of the event.

Please reach out to sam@superfluid.finance with any questions. Happy hacking! ðŸš€
